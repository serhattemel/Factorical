# Factorical

This game was developed by `Serhat Temel` and `Necdet Gedik` as a graduation project for the Computer Engineering department at BalÄ±kesir University.

Factorical is a three-dimensional strategy automation game. The main objective of the game is for the player to build structures on the map that will process resources like wood or iron. These structures, once built by the player, automatically process designated resources and produce new materials. For example, processed wood is converted into lumber. These materials are then transported to the next processing station via production lines, depending on the player's strategic plan. Over time, the system becomes more complex.

## Game Features and Algorithms
1- `Grid System and Grid Snapping:` Dividing the map into squares to place objects on these squares.

2- `Cellular Automata:` For generating random maps.

3- `Perlin Noise:` For random resource generation on the map.

4- `Belt System:` To transport resources from one point to another.
